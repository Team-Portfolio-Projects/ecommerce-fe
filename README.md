App Overview

This will be a full-stack e-commerce application complete with user authentication (via oAuth) and some measure of analytics provided to admin level users. Generic users will be able to search for and filter from a list of products (retrieved either from a 3rd party API or from a set of randomly seeded data) and “purchase” those products.

Please see the application’s tech stack below:

Frontend -  Reactjs /
Backend - Express Mongoose/ Node / oAuth
DB - Mongo
